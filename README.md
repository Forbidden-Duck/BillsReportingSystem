## Warnings / Information

### How can I restore information I had before I clicked "Save to CSV"
You can't, the restore button reads the "CSV" file to restore data.

### How can I add more than 1 student / question at once
I didn't not implement this feature. This application is just a demonstration and that feature was not in the Project Requirements. The same thing applies with deleting.
